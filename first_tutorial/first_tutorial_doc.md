## Create a folder and open in the folder

```bash
mkdir first_tutorial && cd first_tutorial
```
## Import the folder in vscode
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> and select your project path
## Create dotnet project
- Firstly check dotnetcore, if you paste this command;
```bash
dotnet --info
```
Then give a basic information about on .Net sdk:
```terminal

Or you can check only verision

```
Now, we create a .Net project in our path, firstly would go the path:
```bash
cd ~/csharp_tutorials/first_tutorial
```
And check our location in terminal:
```bash
pwd
```
The output as like this;
```terminal
/home/nesh/csharp_tutorials/first_tutorial
```
After the checking run this command;
```bash
dotnet new console
```
If dont a mistake, the outputs would be these;
```terminal
The template "Console App" was created successfully.

Processing post-creation actions...
Running 'dotnet restore' on /home/nesh/csharp_tutorials/first_tutorial/first_tutorial.csproj...
  Determining projects to restore...
  Restored /home/nesh/csharp_tutorials/first_tutorial/first_tutorial.csproj (in 94 ms).
Restore succeeded.
```
And dotnet has been create a obj folder, and a .csprojfile and .cs file, i 'll mention to files and folder but now, we try a print some words("Hello, aliens!") on terminal in the first tutorial.

- Now, open the **_Program.cs_** file;
```c#
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```
You see a comment line and a Console.WriteLine method(this method works same std::cout or printf), i change the sentence and remove the comment line;
```c#
Console.WriteLine("Hello, Aliens!");
```
Lets try get to compile and run;
```bash
dotnet run
```
If dont any mistake, A **bin** (1) folder create in your path and you must see the output message;
```terminal
Hello, Aliens!
```

## Notes:
- (1) I ignore the bin folders in repo hense you couldn't find any bin folder.
